# Image Verification Captcha

This Python script implements a simple image verification captcha using Tkinter and PIL. The captcha consists of two modules: one for bridge verification and another for animal verification.

## Instructions

1. **Bridge Verification Module:**
   - Select all the bridges.
   - Unselect all the roads.
   - Click the "Submit" button to verify.

2. **Animal Verification Module:**
   - Select all the cats.
   - Unselect all the dogs and calves.
   - Click the "Submit" button to verify.

3. **Not a Robot Checkbox:**
   - Check the "I am not a robot" checkbox before submitting.
   - This helps prevent automated submissions.

4. **Refresh:**
   - Click the "Refresh" button to reset the captcha.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## Dependencies

- Tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)

## Notes

- The script uses image files located in the "Human Verification Captcha/IMAGES" directory.
- Adjust the paths if necessary.
- Contributions and improvements are welcome.
